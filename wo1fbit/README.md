# 365-days of hacking

It's 2nd january 2023. Can't believe we're already on the second day of 2023!!!. 2022 is now "just the other day". "Just the other day" I didn't learn as much as I'd like to so I decided to make this year worth the while. Looking back on the gone year, (rip 2022) I realise that I was involved in almost every category of hacking --web, pwn, rev, pwn ....name it I was there.... except crypto (maths is fun but tf!! crypto is just on another level of madness). The problem with being everywhere is you just don't learn a lot. Yeah you have an idea of all what is going on but you can't really say you're good on sth. It becomes a case of "jack of all trades and master of none". So for this year I've really thought about it and decided that my passion and current goals is in taking good care of small buffers that hold lots of good "trusted" input :), some stack canaries, a little bit of no PE and some ASLR, not forgetting some mov and jmp and .sections and #include's. I have decided to learn and focus and put at least 1.5 hrs+/day of my time doing pwn, reverse engineering and extending my knowledge of Assembly, C and Python. Yeah, they are all related. I guess this is it, the time is finally here, tt sure is going to be a hell of a time but the results justifies the work. See you all on the other side of the tunnel. Hope I can make it. See you all on 2nd january 2024, my final 365 day.
